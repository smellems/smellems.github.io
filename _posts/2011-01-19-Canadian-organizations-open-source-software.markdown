In 2005, Statistics Canada conducted a survey of electronic commerce and technology. It was the first time that data on the use and development of open source software were collected. The results were published in the [Innovation Analysis Bulletin in 2006](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/cgi-bin/af-fdr.cgi?l=fra&loc=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/88-003-x/88-003-x2006002-fra.pdf&t=Bulletin%20de%20l%27analyse%20en%20innovation). The use of open source software was already a trend that was increasing.

## Use
The % of companies who responded using open source software in 2005.
- Private sector : 10%
- Public sector : 52% 

- Small : 9%
- Medium : 16%
- Large : 37% 

## Industry Sectors
The % of companies who responded using open source software in 2005.
- Information and cultural : 37%
- Public services and education : 22%
- Professional, scientific and technical services : 20% 

Companies in these sectors are already heavy users of information technology and are more willing to assess the benefits that can come with open source software.
Development

Only 2% of companies responded that they were developing open source software in 2005.
- Information and cultural sector : 13%
- Large companies : 9%
- Public sector : 15% 

In conclusion, the author expects an increase in the use and development as organizations report their use of free software and realize the benefits they offer. In 2011, the federal and provincial governments are giving more and more space to open source software. This fosters trust for open source software.
